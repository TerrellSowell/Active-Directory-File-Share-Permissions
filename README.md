## Objective

This Active Directory Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and creating network files and permissions on Active Directory. The primary focus was to create and analyze file share and permissions within a Domain Controller, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world helpdesk scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network files and permissions .

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding file sharing.
- Ability to generate and recognize user permissions.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
